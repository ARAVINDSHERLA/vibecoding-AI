# VibeCoding

Welcome to VibeCoding, a collaborative space dedicated to the art and practice of coding with vibes. This repository aims to collect wisdom, techniques, and insights about the human aspects of programming that often go undiscussed.

## What is VibeCoding?

VibeCoding is about recognizing that programming isn't just a technical discipline‚Äîit's a deeply human activity influenced by our psychology, environment, and emotional state. In the modern AI-assisted coding era, vibe coders are the conductors, directing AI to transform creative vision into functional code.

## Copy-Paste Examples üìã

Need quick examples to use with your AI assistant? Here are some ready-to-use prompts:

### For Project Setup
```
I want to start a new [project type] with a [aesthetic style] vibe. Help me set up the project structure following modern best practices for [technology stack]. The project should feel [describe emotional quality] and create an experience that's [describe user experience]. Let's start by creating a high-level architecture and directory structure.
```

### For Feature Implementation
```
I need to implement a [feature description] for my [project type]. The feature should match our [aesthetic style] vibe, with [specific visual/interaction details]. Here's the existing structure:

[paste relevant project information]

Create the implementation with a focus on [priority aspect: performance/aesthetics/maintainability]. The code should feel like it's part of our existing ecosystem.
```

### For Code Review
```
Review this code implementation for our [feature name]. It should embody our [aesthetic style] vibe but I'm not sure if it's capturing the right feel. I'm specifically concerned about [concern area]. How can we refine it to better match our intended experience?

[paste code to review]
```

### For Debugging
```
I'm encountering an issue with our [feature] implementation. The current behavior is [describe problem], but I expect it to [describe desired behavior]. The feature is supposed to have a [aesthetic style] vibe, but the bug is disrupting that feeling. Here's the relevant code:

[paste code with issue]

Help me diagnose the problem and suggest fixes that maintain our aesthetic vision.
```

(.) I'm building a project or webapp, but it's not really coding - I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works".
